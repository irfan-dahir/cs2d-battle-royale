# cs2d-battle-royale
Just an old CS2D game mode project I worked on.

Drag and drop in you `/sys/lua` folder & add `dofile('sys/lua/battle-royale/main.lua')` in your `server.lua`.

For the loot crates to work, you need to name the `trigger` of a breakable or use entity to `container`.

Do whatever you want with this.
